# End-to-end Testing with Selenium and Typescript

Sample project to demonstrate end-to-end (e2e) tests written with selenium and typescript.

## 1 Pre-requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Version control
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript execution environment
- [`chromedriver`] compatible with your version of Chrome:
    - To verify the chromedriver: `npm install chromedriver@latest`
- The chromedriver will be installed in `node_modules/.bin/chromedriver`

**Note:** When installing Node.js, npm is automatically installed. 🚀

## 2 Installation

- To install the dev dependencies: `npm install` (or `npm i` for short.)

## 3 Reports with Mochawesome

- To install packages for advanced reports: `npm install --save-dev mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator`
    * This command install three differents packages:

     3.1 `mochawesome`: Generates rich HTML and JSON reports from the execution of Mocha tests.
     3.2 `mochawesome-merge`: Combining JSON reports generated by 'mochawesome' into a single file.
     3.3 `mochawesome-report-generator`: Generates visual reports (HTML) from the combined JSON files.

## 4 Tests with Typescript

- To install the mocha: `npm install ts-mocha@latest --save-dev`
    * This command is specific to 'TypeScript' projects and makes it easy to run tests directly with 'ts-mocha', without having to compile TypeScript to JavaScript manually:
    
    `2.4 ts-mocha`: A wrapper that allows you to run tests written in TypeScript using Mocha,       without having to manually compile the code before running it.
    `2.5 @latest`: Ensures that you install the latest available version of the package.
    npm install ts-mocha --save-dev

## 5 Chai assertion library

- To install the chai: `npm install chai --save-dev`
    * This command is essential for adding 'Chai' to your project as a development dependency. It is more generic and is used in many testing frameworks besides Mocha:

    `2.6 chai`: This is a library of assertions for tests. It is used to verify that test results are correct.

In summary

* `mochawesome`, `mochawesome-merge` and `mochawesome-report-generator`: For detailed test reports.
* `ts-mocha`: To run tests in TypeScript without compiling manually.
* `chai`: To make assertions in tests.    

## 6 Running the tests

- To run all tests: 'npm test'
- To run all tests with report: 'npm run test-report'
- Download the extension 'Mocha Test Explorer' in the vscode

## 📋 7 Features

- Automating web interface tests with Selenium.
- Use of the **Page Object Model** standard to organize page elements and actions.
- Automatically generated execution reports.
- Configuration with **TypeScript** for better typing and productivity.
- Easy extensibility for new tests and maintenance.
